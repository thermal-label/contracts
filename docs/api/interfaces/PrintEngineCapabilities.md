# Interface: PrintEngineCapabilities

Engine-level capability flags.

Mirrors `DeviceEntry.capabilities` but for properties of the
printhead / sensor / cutter on this specific engine. Open shape —
drivers extend with family-specific keys via the index signature
without touching the contracts package.

**Promotion rule:** a capability earns a named key here iff (a) it
is implemented by ≥2 active drivers AND (b) at least one registry
consumer (picker, rasterizer, docs badge, runtime UX) actually
branches on it. Today: `mediaDetection` and `autocut`.
Single-vendor (e.g. `twoColor`, `genuineMediaRequired`) lands on
the index signature until a second vendor adopts.

## Indexable

```ts
[k: string]: unknown
```

Driver-specific capability keys land here. Examples today:
`twoColor` (Brother-only, two-colour ribbon path) and
`genuineMediaRequired` (Dymo-only). Promote to a named key when
a second active driver implements with compatible semantics.

## Properties

| Property | Type | Description |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| <a id="property-autocut"></a> `autocut?` | `boolean` | Auto-cutter on this engine's paper path. |
| <a id="property-mediadetection"></a> `mediaDetection?` | `boolean` | Whether this engine reports loaded media via `getStatus()`. What apps do on mismatch is an app-level decision; the contracts library does not block prints. See `hardwareQuirks` on entries where the printer's mismatch behaviour is non-obvious (Brother QL hard-rejects, Dymo 5xx silently misprints). |
